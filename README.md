# BlockWindows - iLag's edition.
A personal modification of BlockWindows with a number of minute changes.  The original readme, minus the soon-to-be-outdated mirror links, is below.  Read through that for more information.

Changes: (Assuming they haven't already been implemented)
- Typo fixes.
- A not-fully-tested method of checking for admin.
- hosts.bat looks in the current directory for hosts instead of My Downloads

Rewrite-specific changes:
- A completely-rewritten BlockWindows.bat (FOR the heck of it)
- All line endings coverted to Windows-style (CRLF)

PS There is a highly concerted effort by Microsoft Employees to harass websites that link to this. I'm tired of constantly trying to convince website admins it's not spam.

Please repost these URLs many places on social media, blogs, etc. I'm in it for the long haul.
